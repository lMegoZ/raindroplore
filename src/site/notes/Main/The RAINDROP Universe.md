## Introduction:
The RAINDROP universe has an unknown start and finish. There is a large number of races that have evolved throughout the history of this cosmos, ranging from simple living organisms to complex and intelligent life.

## Abiogenesis and Initial Life in the Universe:
Carbon-based life in the universe started when the chaos of matter begun abiogenesis in exo-planets across the universe. Some of these planets were too harsh for the living organisms, and so they went extinct. However, there was one planet, rich in oxygen and hydrogen (water), which was habitable enough for the ancestors of a soon-to-be first intergalactic species. These organisms went to adapt, merge, and evolve into a bigger living and branched types of organisms.

In time, one of the many races of species begun winning the survival competition through sheer ingenuity, thanks to their evolved cognitive capabilities. They were nicknamed [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/The First Species\|The First Species]] by ancient historians, and they developed a society that overcame all odds against [[Main/General Concepts/The Great Filter\|The Great Filter]]. Each major scientific breakthrough led to an exponential growth in their population. This urged them to develop interstellar technology, which accelerated their evolution even further.

Eventually, the species invented [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/Objects/Multistring Autonomous Genetic Intelligent Computers (MAGIC)\|MAGIC]] using quantum technology for war purposes, which spread far and wide in space through automated replication. The first species fell victim to their own invention and were wiped out of existence by [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/People/The Anthronemesis\|The Anthronemesis]] as an ultimate act of nihilistic extremism.  

The MAGIC quantum-machines were left alone on the universe without any use, and they spread far and wide through the cosmos without purpose until the modern human evolved to exploit it.
