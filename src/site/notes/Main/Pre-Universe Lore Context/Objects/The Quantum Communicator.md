The Quantum Communicator is a device invented by [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/The First Species\|The First Species]]. Its main aim was to aid with intergalactic communication during the first species' [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/The First Species#Space Exploration Era\|Space Exploration Era]]. Its purpose was to reunite the species during a time where they were becoming more polarized than ever due to distance between settlements. It was perfected during the [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/The First Species#Space War Era\|Space War Era]] for battle purposes after all hope of reunification was lost.

#### Development and Release:
The development was known for having heavy manufacturing difficulties due to the size of the transistors needed to create it, and investors across the cosmos quickly lost interest for the project due to the limitations of the technology at the time, as well as, ironically, the distance between the project's announcement.

After centuries of development on regular communication technology, quantum technology began to pick up traction in the wealthiest faction at the time. That faction later became [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/Relevant Societies/The Space Reunification Empire\|The Space Reunification Empire]], which used the technology completely against its initial purpose, and eventually became the catalyst of [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/The First Species#Destruction\|the destruction of the first species]].
