The Multistring Autonomous Genetic Intelligent Computers (or MAGIC for short) are a system of quantum-sized non-sentient machines able to manipulate the vibrations of strings, which are the scaffolding of this universe, and it is what makes all matter and energy exist. The machines are able to communicate with each other at an instant rate by using a miniature version of [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/Objects/The Quantum Communicator\|The Quantum Communicator]], which revolutionized instant-communication.

#### Development: 
The MAGIC system was created by an imperial scientist during the first species' [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/The First Species#Space War Era\|The Space War Era]]
and further developed with the help of his wife, [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/People/The Anthronemesis\|The Anthronemesis]]. According to historical remains, it began as a prototype aimed for automated medical procedures. Eventually [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/Relevant Societies/The Space Reunification Empire\|The Space Reunification Empire]] saw the potential on the technology and forcefully hired the scientist to adapt its invention for war. The project's pace was severely slowed due to it having to undergo major overhauls. After the imperial scientist met the anthronemesis, the project's speed accelerated, and during its final stages of testing, was halted by [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/People/The Anthronemesis#Betrayal and Technological Manipulation\|The Anthronemesis' Treason Confession]] and released without further changes.

#### Destruction of the First Species:
The MAGIC system has an admin-level [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/Concepts/Neuroglyphs#Built-in Methods\|Neuroglyphs#Built-in Methods]] that allowed the anthronemesis to [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/The First Species#Destruction\|eradicate]] the first species from existence. It is unknown if the anthronemesis remained alive after the extinction event.
