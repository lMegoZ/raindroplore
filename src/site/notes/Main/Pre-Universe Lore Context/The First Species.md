> [!attention]-  TWIST SPOILER: Species Name
> Old Humans
## Timeline

#### Inception
Not much is known about the species' inception, but we know that they started as many other developing species do. First they discovered fire, and invented tools to hunt, and eventually invented their own society groups. They were divided by regions across the continents.

#### History
Their history began when they invented scripture and writing. It is said that during that time, war was very common among their nations. Various tribes and kingdoms fought over resources, territory, and ideology. Their conflicts were both a source of great suffering and a catalyst for rapid technological and cultural advancements. They created monuments and structures that stood for millennia, many of which still puzzle us with their complexity and purpose.

As their societies grew more complex, they developed systems of governance, trade, and law. They explored the natural world, seeking to understand their place within it. They constructed cities of remarkable scale, home to millions, where arts and sciences flourished. Philosophers and thinkers from different regions would ponder the mysteries of existence, the nature of their reality, and the possibilities beyond their own world.

#### First Industrial Revolution and First Space Travel
The species' ingenuity led them to harness the power of the elements, creating tools, machines, and devices that transformed their way of life. They also began to understand the fundamental principles of our universe. This period of exploration and discovery saw them venture beyond their planet, reaching out to their closest celestial neighbors for the first time as a species.

#### Struggles and Adaptation Through Communication
Ideological, and cultural differences often sparked conflict, yet these also drove them to innovate and adapt. They invented ways of communication through advanced networks. These networks allowed them to share ideas at convenient speeds from large distances. Thus, they became more self-aware, and actively battled their own demons to become a better species.

#### Space Exploration Era
The species reached their interplanetary stage, where space travel gradually became accessible. They begun to ruthlessly conquer other worlds, and take their resources to grow as a species. They found life to be extremely rare, and if there was, it was extremely primitive and not intelligent. This made them even more proud of their own species, and this encouraged them to explore the universe even further.

At this point, the species was beginning to struggle with intergalactic communication. So they begun to find better ways to communicate at instantaneous speeds. They begun exploring quantum technology.

However, quantum technology proved to be the species' biggest challenge, and it took dozens of centuries. Sadly, by the time they managed to invent the first [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/Objects/The Quantum Communicator\|The Quantum Communicator]], their colonies were already divided into many factions that forgot where they came from. The technology's purpose became obsolete, and with a titanic size of the species population spread across the cosmos, they lost their ability to reunite quadrillions of souls, and conflict soon ensued.

#### Space War Era
During the space wars, some factions and the [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/Relevant Societies/The Space Reunification Empire\|The Space Reunification Empire]] used the communication technology for war purposes. They prioritized advancement in technology in order to garner the advantage. Their knowledge of the universe has expanded exponentially since the invention of the quantum communicator, so they came around to make new tools to manipulate the fabric of reality itself through the quantum realm. In a scientific breakthrough of biblical proportions, the first [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/Objects/Multistring Autonomous Genetic Intelligent Computers (MAGIC)\|Multistring Autonomous Genetic Intelligent Computers (MAGIC)]] were invented and released to space. They were able to replicate themselves, and manipulate matter and energy however they wanted, at the quantum-string level. This was the species' magnus opus, and they had reached godhood.

#### Destruction
During the Space Wars, [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/People/The Anthronemesis\|The Anthronemesis]] rose the ranks and married the imperial scientist responsible for the creation of the MAGIC system with the intention of eradicating the species. She created the [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/Concepts/Neuroglyphs\|Neuroglyphs]], an extremely rich language designed to be hard to master. This gave her exclusive control to some apocalyptic [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/Concepts/Neuroglyphs#Built-in Methods\|methods]] she created to make the use of the system easier. Following the [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/People/The Anthronemesis#Legacy\|assassination of her husband]], she eradicated the entirety of the first species.
