#### Early Origins
During  the Anthronemesis emerged from a remote colony at the galaxy's edge. Orphaned early by the conflicts that ravaged her species, she inherited only echoes of her parents' virtues. Her early solace was a close companion from her youth, with whom she ventured into mercenary life on a lawless planet.

#### Background
The Anthronemesis, a notable figure during the [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/The First Species#Space War Era\|The Space War Era]], originated from a small, outer-galaxy colony impacted by a widespread conflict. Early orphaned by the war, little is known about her parents except for their involvement against the initial colonization efforts of the enemy factions. Her early life was marked by survival and resilience, leading to her eventual career as a mercenary alongside a childhood friend.

#### Career and Innovations
The Anthronemesis and her associate became known for their technical skills, particularly in repurposing space debris into useful technologies. These innovations were primarily developed during their tenure at a mercenary hideout, which later became a target of an empire seeking control over the planet's resources. The hideout's destruction, resulting in significant personal loss for the Anthronemesis, catalyzed her pursuit of vengeance against the empire.

#### Infiltration and Ascension
Over several years, the Anthronemesis successfully infiltrated the ranks of the empire responsible for her grievances. She gained trust and access to sensitive information by leveraging her technological prowess. Her rise within the empire was also facilitated by a personal relationship with a fellow inventor, who remained unaware of her true intentions.

#### Betrayal and Technological Manipulation
Her major contribution to the empire was in the development of the [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/Concepts/Neuroglyphs\|Neuroglyphs]] for the [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/Objects/Multistring Autonomous Genetic Intelligent Computers (MAGIC)\|MAGIC]] bots. Unbeknownst to her colleagues, she embedded a destructive function within the MAGIC bots capable of targeting and destroying specific commanded species. This technology was central to her strategy for revenge. Upon discovery by her husband, she orchestrated a scenario framing both for treason, effectively discrediting any warnings he might issue.

#### Legacy
The release of the MAGIC bots led to widespread chaos and the manipulation of matter across several systems caused by [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/Relevant Societies/The Space Reunification Empire\|The Space Reunification Empire]]. The Anthronemesis' plans for extinction were temporarily halted following a confrontation with her husband, who had escaped imprisonment and sought reconciliation. However, after his death during a subsequent capture by the empire, she [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/The First Species#Destruction\|wiped the first species from existence.]]

#### Historical Impact
The Anthronemesis remains a pivotal figure in universal history. The precise mastery of Neuroglyphs attributed solely to her has not been replicated.
