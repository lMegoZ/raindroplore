The neuroglyphs are the main language used to manipulate one of [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/Objects/Multistring Autonomous Genetic Intelligent Computers (MAGIC)\|MAGIC]]. It was created by one of [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/The First Species\|The First Species]]'s imperial inventors, [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/People/The Anthronemesis\|The Anthronemesis]], during the [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/The First Species#Space War Era\|Space War Era]] in order to obtain total control of the universe.

### Syntax:
Unlike conventional languages, the neuroglyphs aren't a visual or an auditory language. As the name implies, the language uses neurological patterns that the MAGIC quantum-bots decipher and use as instructions for commands. Nobody knows exactly the syntax of the language as it is extremely convoluted. It is known that the language uses a variety of environmental and neurological factors.

#### Environmental/Neurological factors:
The environmental or neurological factors that determine the potency, type, and reach of the magic spells are the following in order of importance:
- User's Desired Spell - Without a desired thing to be realized, there is no command.
- Ancient Knowledge - Lost to time, it is key to give the user access to the dev tools that were used for debugging and changing the source code of the MAGIC bots using the mind. It was used to [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/The First Species#Destruction\|eliminate the first species from existence]]. It consists of [[Main/Pre-Universe Lore Context/People/The Anthronemesis#Early Origins\|The Anthronemesis' life experiences]].
- Trinkets - Objects and wearables, its presences are detected by the quantum-machines.
- Collective Will - Makes it possible to enhance a command with a group of people.
- Light Exposure - Inhibits/enhances certain commands based on light.
- Self-Worth - Inhibits/enhances certain commands based on the user's confidence.
- Gravitational Pull - Inhibits/enhances certain commands based on the user's gravitational pull.
- Genetics - Inhibits/enhances certain commands depending on the user's DNA.

SELF NOTE: It is possible to fake the magic's environmental factors using only neurological factors. Those are called magic exploits, and are the main method the [[Main/Main Universe Lore Context/Species/Gods/Megas Species\|Megas Species]] learnt magic.

#### Built-in Methods:
Methods are predefined operations or routines that the machines can execute to manipulate the universe's fundamental strings. Similar to methods in programming languages, these serve the purpose of reusing specific functionalities across different instances, allowing the machines to perform complex tasks such as altering the vibration of strings to change the state of matter or energy. Each method can be called upon to achieve specific effects, enhancing modularity and interaction within the system. Methods can also call other methods to achieve maximum performance. Some example of methods include:

- DisentangleReduce - Reduces quantum entanglement to diminish interactions. It can be used to inhibit enemy commands.
- VibrationControl - Manipulates the vibrational energy of molecules, potentially altering thermal properties or even influencing sound transmission.
- CompoundHarden - Increases the hardness of materials, making them more resistant to physical damage.
- OpticalRefract - Alters the index of refraction of materials, changing how light bends as it passes through them.

These methods were created by The Anthronemesis using a supercomputer to teach the bots the desired operations. Thus far, very few beings have been able to create new and groundbreaking methods. It takes a very good knowledge of reality itself to do so, and most general-use methods are already built-in.
